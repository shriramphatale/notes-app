# Notes-App

A simple web-based note-taking application built with React + Vite.  
Allows users to create, edit, and manage personal notes — a lightweight and easy-to-use notes app as a part of my learning projects.

## 🧠 Purpose & Motivation

I built this project to practice and solidify my skills with modern frontend tooling: React for UI, Vite for fast bundling and development, and to get familiar with best practices like module organization, linting setup, and project structure.  
As a final-year student learning web development, this project helps me experiment with building real-world web apps.

## ✨ Features

- Create new notes  
- Edit existing notes  
- Delete notes  
- A simple, clean user interface  
- Uses modern frontend stack — React + Vite + standard HTML/CSS/JavaScript
